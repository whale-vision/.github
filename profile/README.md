# 🐋 Whale Vision

Welcome to **Whale Vision** — advancing marine conservation with AI-powered whale identification!


## 🌊 About Us

Whale Vision is dedicated to empowering researchers and conservationists with cutting-edge tools for non-invasive, accurate, and automated identification of individual sperm whales and other cetaceans. Our open-source platform leverages deep learning and user-friendly design to accelerate whale monitoring and research worldwide.


## 🚀 Whale Vision Application

### Identify Whales in Seconds

Our flagship application uses neural networks to recognise individual whales from photographs of flukes and flanks, streamlining the traditionally manual process of photo-ID.


## ✨ Features

- **Drag & Drop Dataset Creation**
- **Deep Learning-Based Identification**
- **GPU Acceleration**
- **Real-Time Progress Updates**
- **Easy Export for Research**
